Create a new class for bank account.
Create fields for the account number, balance, customer name, email and phone number.

Create getters and setters for each field.
Create two additional methods:
1. To allow the customer to deposit funds (this should increment the balance field).
2. To allow the customer to withdrawl funds. This should deduct from the balance field, but not allow to withdrawl
to complete if there are insufficient funds.

You will want to create variuos code in the Main class (the one created by IntelliJ) to confirm your code is working.

Add some system.out.println's in the two methods above as well.
